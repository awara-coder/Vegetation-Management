# Vegetation Management

## Problem Statement
-- Maintaining appropriate distance of tree-tops from high voltage wires.
-- To ensure safe, reliable and economical electric service.

## Devised Solution
-- **Segementation of Video frame** - Achieved via OpenCV python library for Image Processing.
-- **Calculation of relative depth** - Storing the depth values and subtracting the corresponding values to provide relative depth values.
-- **Relative Graph Depth** - Plotting the graph with the values provided and analysing the information to provide alert of dangerous situations. Achieved via ChartJS.
